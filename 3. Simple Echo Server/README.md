# Simple Echo Server

This is a single-threaded, local loopback echo server built with .NET.
The server listens on a specified port and echoes back any messages received from the client.

Instructions:
1. Run the Server Project first.
2. Then, run the Client Project to connect to the server.

This setup demonstrates basic TCP chat communication between a client and server.
